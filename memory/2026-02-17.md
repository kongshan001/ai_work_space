## System: OpenClaw Token Usage Analysis

### Issue
OpenClaw session showing high token usage: 157k/205k (77% context usage), 0 compactions.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Thinking accumulation**: 39 thinking blocks stored in session history
2. **Tool result buildup**: 37 tool calls with full output retained
3. **Cache usage**: 7-13k cache read per request (counts toward usage)
4. **No compaction**: Safeguard mode never triggered at 77%
5. **Project context**: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, README.md loaded on every session

### Optimization Recommendations
- Turn off thinking mode: `/reasoning off`
- Manual compaction: `openclaw restart`
- Change compaction mode to "aggressive" in config
- Use sub-sessions for long-running tasks
- Selective file loading to reduce initial context

### Infrastructure Notes
- System cron jobs (not OpenClaw cron) running GitHub trending reports:
  - Daily: 18:00 GMT+8 - `scripts/generate-daily-trends.sh`
  - Weekly: Sunday 20:00 GMT+8 - `scripts/generate-weekly-trends.sh`
- Both scripts auto-commit and push to `kongshan001/ai_work_space` repo
